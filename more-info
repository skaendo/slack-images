Marlboro Tux (2):
The following are two clever takes on Slackware's version of Tux, that being with a traditional tobacco-type pipe in his bill (mouth), however the pipe in Tux's bill really isn't reflective of smoking either tobacco or illegal drugs. These are here however, because they are rather creative and well done Slackware graphics parodies.
